Here's a simple Python project idea for a beginner to build a coffee shop system. The project will simulate a basic coffee shop where users can order coffee, view prices, and make payments. It will use Python’s built-in features like dictionaries and loops to simulate the functionality.

Coffee Shop Project
Features:
Display the menu with different coffee options and prices.
Allow customers to select coffee from the menu.
Calculate the total price based on the customer's selection.
Accept payment (simulate payment process).
Provide a receipt at the end of the transaction.
Code:
python
Copy code
# Coffee Shop Python Project

# Coffee menu with prices
menu = {
    "Espresso": 2.50,
    "Latte": 3.00,
    "Cappuccino": 3.50,
    "Americano": 2.00,
    "Mocha": 3.75
}

# Function to display the menu
def display_menu():
    print("Welcome to the Coffee Shop!")
    print("Here is our menu:")
    for coffee, price in menu.items():
        print(f"{coffee}: ${price:.2f}")

# Function to take the customer's order
def take_order():
    order = []
    while True:
        choice = input("Please choose a coffee from the menu (or type 'done' to finish): ").title()
        if choice == 'Done':
            break
        elif choice in menu:
            order.append(choice)
            print(f"{choice} added to your order!")
        else:
            print("Sorry, we don't have that coffee. Please choose again.")
    return order

# Function to calculate the total price
def calculate_total(order):
    total = 0
    for item in order:
        total += menu[item]
    return total

# Function to process the payment
def process_payment(total):
    print(f"Your total is: ${total:.2f}")
    while True:
        try:
            payment = float(input("Enter your payment amount: $"))
            if payment < total:
                print("Insufficient payment. Please enter the correct amount.")
            else:
                change = payment - total
                print(f"Thank you for your payment! Your change is: ${change:.2f}")
                break
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid amount.")

# Function to print the receipt
def print_receipt(order, total):
    print("\n--- Receipt ---")
    print("Your Order:")
    for item in order:
        print(f"{item}: ${menu[item]:.2f}")
    print(f"Total: ${total:.2f}")
    print("Thank you for visiting our Coffee Shop! Have a great day!\n")

# Main function to run the coffee shop program
def coffee_shop():
    display_menu()
    order = take_order()
    if order:
        total = calculate_total(order)
        process_payment(total)
        print_receipt(order, total)
    else:
        print("No order placed. Goodbye!")

# Run the coffee shop program
if _name_ == "_main_":
    coffee_shop()
How It Works:
Display Menu: The coffee shop menu is shown to the customer with the available items and prices.
Taking Order: The customer selects coffee from the menu (or types done when finished).
Calculate Total: Once the order is taken, the program calculates the total price based on the selection.
Process Payment: The user is asked to input payment. The program checks if the amount is enough and calculates the change if necessary.
Receipt: A receipt is printed at the end with the order summary and total.
Run the Program:
Save the code in a Python file (e.g., coffee_shop.py).
Run the file in your terminal or an IDE.
Follow the prompts to place an order, make payment, and receive a receipt.
This project can be expanded further by adding more features, such as discounts, inventory management, or even using a database to store orders and customer data. But this basic version is a good starting point for beginners to understand how to structure a Python project and handle user input/output.
